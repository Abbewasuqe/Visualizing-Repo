# Visualizing Repositories Usin Plotly
I have made a Data visualization that shows the relativ popularity of Python projects on GitHub.
I have created an interactiv bar chart: the height of each bar represents the number of stars the project has acquired, and you can click the bar's label to go to that project's home on GitHub.


## How to run the Project
Get this project from Github
``` 
git clone https://github.com/Abbewasuqe/Visualizing-Repositories-Usin-Plotly.git
 
```

### Install the requirements 

``` 
python -m pip install --user requests
```
